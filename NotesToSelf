Bought domain via namecheap.com on 4/09/23
Downloaded Hugo Academic template from Wowchemy.com (demo page https://academic-demo.netlify.app/)
Following tutorials at https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/ on 4/10/23
I can only access my live content here https://main--brian-denny.netlify.app/

But I want to see it live on my site so I can edit as needed (BUT MAYBE THAT ISN'T A GOOD IDEA AND I SHOULD ONLY ADD CONTENT TO MY SITE WHEN IT'S COMPLETE)

Getting content to my domain requires changing DNS names. I changed DNS names in namecheap.com on 4/10/23 using instructions here https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/767/10/how-to-change-dns-for-a-domain/

PROCESS FOR UPDATING CONTENT:

Push changes via GitHub Desktop.
If changes don't reflect on site or you're changing code that isn't visible content, check Netlify deploys to ensure content published.

CHANGES TO MAKE:


DELETED CONTENT:

Gallery block from main page
  - block: markdown
    content:
      title: Gallery
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        {{< gallery album="demo" >}}
    design:
      columns: '1'

Notes from the 'Writing with Markdown' section:
  Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the `syntax_highlighter` option in your `config/_default/params.yaml` file.
  
  Simply insert a Markdown `markmap` code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.

  ### Charts

      supports the popular [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) format for interactive charts.

      Save your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example `line-chart.json`, and then add the `{{</* chart data="line-chart" */>}}` shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.

     Demo:

      {{< chart data="line-chart" >}}

      You might also find the [Plotly JSON Editor](http://plotly-json-editor.getforge.io/) useful.
  
  ### Latex
      You can enable this feature by toggling the `math` option in your `config/_default/params.yaml` file.

      To render _inline_ or _block_ math, wrap your LaTeX math with `{{</* math */>}}$...${{</* /math */>}}` or `{{</* math */>}}$$...$${{</* /math */>}}`, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy _math_ shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The _math_ shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)

  ### Diagrams
    You can enable this feature by toggling the `diagram` option in your `config/_default/params.toml` file or by adding `diagram: true` to your page front matter.

  ### Tables
    You can also convert a spreadsheet into a Markdown table. Simply save the spreadsheet as a CSV file in your page's folder and then render it by adding the _Table_ shortcode to your page:

From 'Getting Started' section:
  (this code didn't seem to render properly)
    ```python
    import libr
    print('hello')
    ```
