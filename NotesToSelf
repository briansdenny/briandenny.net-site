Bought domain via namecheap.com on 4/09/23
Downloaded Hugo Academic template from Wowchemy.com (demo page https://academic-demo.netlify.app/)
Following tutorials at https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/ on 4/10/23
I can only access my live content here https://main--brian-denny.netlify.app/

But I want to see it live on my site so I can edit as needed (BUT MAYBE THAT ISN'T A GOOD IDEA AND I SHOULD ONLY ADD CONTENT TO MY SITE WHEN IT'S COMPLETE)

Getting content to my domain requires changing DNS names. I changed DNS names in namecheap.com on 4/10/23 using instructions here https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/767/10/how-to-change-dns-for-a-domain/

PROCESS FOR UPDATING CONTENT:
Edit content in Visual Studio Code.
Commit the changes via GitHub Desktop. 
Push changes via GitHub Desktop.
If changes don't reflect on site or you're changing code that isn't visible content, check Netlify deploys to ensure content published.
