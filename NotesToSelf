Bought domain via namecheap.com on 4/09/23
Downloaded Hugo Academic template from Wowchemy.com (demo page https://academic-demo.netlify.app/)
Following tutorials at https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/ on 4/10/23
I can only access my live content here https://main--brian-denny.netlify.app/

But I want to see it live on my site so I can edit as needed (BUT MAYBE THAT ISN'T A GOOD IDEA AND I SHOULD ONLY ADD CONTENT TO MY SITE WHEN IT'S COMPLETE)

Getting content to my domain requires changing DNS names. I changed DNS names in namecheap.com on 4/10/23 using instructions here https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/767/10/how-to-change-dns-for-a-domain/

SETTING UP SITE:
Bought name/email from namecheap
Downloaded Academic from Wowchemy
Downloaded VSCode, GitHub desktop


PROCESS FOR UPDATING CONTENT:
Edit content in Visual Studio Code.
Commit the changes via GitHub Desktop. 
Push changes via GitHub Desktop.
