The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of standards and instructions for ensuring that web content (e.g. websites, mobile apps, PDFs) are accessible to people with disabilities. Conformance with WCAG criteria results in web content that is more perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust for more users; it helps meet the needs of real users in the real world. Accessibility is mandated for federal entities under Section 508 of the Rehabilition Act and for most businesses under the Americans with Disabilities Act. When a business is sued for failing to provide an accessible website, judgment frequently requires the business to comply with WCAG criteria. As a Technical Writer at Consensus Cloud Solutions who designs and implements Whatfix microcontent for the web, I have to ensure the content I create is accessible and conforms to WCAG criteria.
