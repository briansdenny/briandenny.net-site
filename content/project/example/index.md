jQuery selectors are used to select HTML elements on a webpage based on the element attributes (e.g. id, class, attribute, type, value, etc.) specified in the jQuery selector. This functionality allows web developers to identify and interact with HTML elements in a variety of ways. For instance, digital adoption platforms like Whatfix, Userpilot, and WalkMe allow  content developers to configure display rules for microcontent based on jQuery selectors. In my role as a Technical Writer at Consensus Cloud Solutions, I spearhead the company's work with Whatfix by ideating, designing, writing, configuring, testing, and analyzing microcontent that sits on top of several of our existing web applications. While teaching myself how to use Whatfix, I also learned the basics of jQuery selectors, and this has allowed me to create more refined, customized, and adaptive Whatfix microcontent. I created [***these step-by-step instructions***](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FHIZ73Q7WXiBeULPJdtQnU52fh-oQejYHUzkf4KBCPM/edit?usp=sharing) specifically for my colleagues as an easy reference sheet allowing them to begin exploring the process of identifying jQuery selectors within one of our web apps and using those selectors in Whatfix display rules.
