Problem: The first major update to Consensus Cloud Solutionsâ€™ recently acquired document signing website allowed users to send recipients multiple documents at once. However, immediately following the update, the customer support team began receiving numerous calls from customers who could not locate their additional documents. 

Solution: I designed and created [***a popup with an embedded GIF***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M6-qfvQiQeJNT44Zo1Nrqeso4fRUjaZT/view?usp=sharing) showing users exactly where their additional documents were located. I used jQuery selectors to identify users sending multiple documents and ensure only those users were shown the popup and only at the right time. I also included a simple feedback mechanism on the popup to evaluate its helpfulness.
