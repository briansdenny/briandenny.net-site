Problem: Product leadership at Consensus Cloud Solutions wanted to shape an upcoming sales campaign but found the existing marketing material both too complex and too vague to entice potential customers. I was asked to write several shorter, more compelling marketing pieces for potential inclusion in a future email campaign. 

Solution: After reviewing the existing marketing material, I devised a list of questions to ensure I sufficiently understood the product. After gathering responses to those questions from SMEs in the Product department, I then began writing with the goal of turning out [***concise marketing pieces***](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mx04YMMvGGacIVRiFUY_4pr98eu_u4Zf/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=112942925481969310177&rtpof=true&sd=true) that emphasize the brand name and functionality, things missing in the existing marketing material.
