abstract: In this presentation, I shared the many successes Consensus Cloud Solutions has seen from our partnership with Whatfix. Those successes include changes to our internal data sharing practices, major influxes of data on our Whatfix content and users' engagement with the underlying application, and a steady shift in the goals and functioning of our technical documentation team. I also discussed several lessons we have learned regarding how to maximize the effectiveness of a shift from traditional technicala writing to a forward-thinking digital adoption content strategy.
