## Mindmaps

Hugo Blox supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.

With this open format, can even edit your mindmaps in other popular tools such as Obsidian.

Simply insert a Markdown code block labelled as `markmap` and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.

Mindmaps can be created by simply writing the items as a Markdown list within the `markmap` code block, indenting each item to create as many sub-levels as you need:

<div class="highlight">
<pre class="chroma">
<code>
```markmap {height="200px"}
- Hugo Modules
  - Hugo Blox
  - blox-plugins-netlify
  - blox-plugins-netlify-cms
  - blox-plugins-reveal
```
</code>
</pre>
</div>

renders as

```markmap {height="200px"}
- Hugo Modules
  - Hugo Blox
  - blox-plugins-netlify
  - blox-plugins-netlify-cms
  - blox-plugins-reveal
```

Anh here's a more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:

<div class="highlight">
<pre class="chroma">
<code>

  - Features
    - Markdown formatting

    - `inline code`
    -

      console.log('hello');
      console.log('code block');
      ```
    - Math: $x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$
```
</code>
</pre>
</div>

renders as

  - Features
    - Markdown formatting
    - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles*
    - multiline
      text
    - `inline code`
    -
      ```js
      console.log('hello');
      console.log('code block');
      ```
    - Math: $x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$
```

## Highlighting

<mark>Highlight</mark> important text with `mark`:

```html
<mark>Highlighted text</mark>
```

## Callouts

Use [callouts](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/markdown/#callouts) (aka _asides_, _hints_, or _alerts_) to draw attention to notes, tips, and warnings.

By wrapping a paragraph in `{{%/* callout note */%}} ... {{%/* /callout */%}}`, it will render as an aside.

```markdown
{{%/* callout note */%}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{%/* /callout */%}}
```

renders as

{{% callout note %}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{% /callout %}}

Or use the `warning` callout type so your readers don't miss critical details:

{{% callout warning %}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{% /callout %}}

[Hugo Blox Builder](https://hugoblox.com) is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and the Hugo Blox Builder which this template is built upon handles the rest.

**Embed videos, podcasts, code, LaTeX math, and even test students!**

On this page, you'll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Hugo Blox.

## Video

Teach your course by sharing videos with your students. Choose from one of the following approaches:

{{< youtube D2vj0WcvH5c >}}

**Youtube**:

    {{</* youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc */>}}

**Bilibili**:

    {{</* bilibili id="BV1WV4y1r7DF" */>}}

**Video file**

Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your `assets/media/` media library or in your [page's folder](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/), and then embedding them with the _video_ shortcode:

    {{</* video src="my_video.mp4" controls="yes" */>}}

## Podcast

You can add a podcast or music to a page by placing the MP3 file in the page's folder or the media library folder and then embedding the audio on your page with the _audio_ shortcode:

    {{</* audio src="ambient-piano.mp3" */>}}

Try it out:

{{< audio src="ambient-piano.mp3" >}}

## Test students

Provide a simple yet fun self-assessment by revealing the solutions to challenges with the `spoiler` shortcode:

```markdown
{{</* spoiler text="üëâ Click to view the solution" */>}}
You found me!
{{</* /spoiler */>}}
```

renders as

{{< spoiler text="üëâ Click to view the solution" >}} You found me üéâ {{< /spoiler >}}

## Math

Hugo Blox Builder supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the `math` option in your `config/_default/params.yaml` file.

To render _inline_ or _block_ math, wrap your LaTeX math with `{{</* math */>}}$...${{</* /math */>}}` or `{{</* math */>}}$$...$${{</* /math */>}}`, respectively.

{{% callout note %}}
We wrap the LaTeX math in the Hugo Blox _math_ shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown.
{{% /callout %}}

Example **math block**:

```latex
{{</* math */>}}
$$
\gamma_{n} = \frac{ \left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T \left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}
$$
{{</* /math */>}}
```

renders as

{{< math >}}
$$\gamma_{n} = \frac{ \left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T \left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}$$
{{< /math >}}

Example **inline math** `{{</* math */>}}$\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n})${{</* /math */>}}` renders as {{< math >}}$\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n})${{< /math >}}.

Example **multi-line math** using the math linebreak (`\\`):

```latex
{{</* math */>}}
$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=1, \\
1-p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=0.\end{cases}$$
{{</* /math */>}}
```

renders as

{{< math >}}

$$
f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=1, \\
1-p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=0.\end{cases}
$$

{{< /math >}}

## Code

Hugo Blox Builder utilises Hugo's Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. The code theme can be selected in the `config/_default/params.yaml` file.


    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
    data.head()
    ```

renders as

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
data.head()
```

## Inline Images

```go
{{</* icon name="python" */>}} Python
```

renders as

{{< icon name="python" >}} Python

## Ideation

Hugo Blox supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.

Simply insert a Markdown code block labelled as `markmap` and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.

Mindmaps can be created by simply writing the items as a Markdown list within the `markmap` code block, indenting each item to create as many sub-levels as you need:

<div class="highlight">
<pre class="chroma">
<code>
```markmap {height="200px"}
- Hugo Modules
  - Hugo Blox
  - blox-plugins-netlify
  - blox-plugins-netlify-cms
  - blox-plugins-reveal
```
</code>
</pre>
</div>

renders as

```markmap {height="200px"}
- Hugo Modules
  - Hugo Blox
  - blox-plugins-netlify
  - blox-plugins-netlify-cms
  - blox-plugins-reveal
```

## Diagrams

Hugo Blox supports the _Mermaid_ Markdown extension for diagrams.

An example **Gantt diagram**:

    ```mermaid
    gantt
    section Section
    Completed :done,    des1, 2014-01-06,2014-01-08
    Active        :active,  des2, 2014-01-07, 3d
    Parallel 1   :         des3, after des1, 1d
    Parallel 2   :         des4, after des1, 1d
    Parallel 3   :         des5, after des3, 1d
    Parallel 4   :         des6, after des4, 1d
    ```

renders as

```mermaid
gantt
section Section
Completed :done,    des1, 2014-01-06,2014-01-08
Active        :active,  des2, 2014-01-07, 3d
Parallel 1   :         des3, after des1, 1d
Parallel 2   :         des4, after des1, 1d
Parallel 3   :         des5, after des3, 1d
Parallel 4   :         des6, after des4, 1d
```

## Todo lists

You can even write your todo lists in Markdown too:

```markdown
- [x] Write math example
  - [x] Write diagram example
- [ ] Do something else
```

renders as

- [x] Write math example
  - [x] Write diagram example
- [ ] Do something else
