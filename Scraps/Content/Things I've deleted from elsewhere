        {{< spoiler text="Click for excerpts from 2024 review" >}}
        Put bluntly, Brian rocked my expectations for this first half of 2024. Under his guidance we were able to:

        - Successfully integrate the DOC brands into Whatfix (WF).
        - Perform our first meaningful A/B test on the eFax portal WF content.
        - Integrate direct CS and Product feedback loops into the portal, giving customers direct access to these teams as a means to solve issues or problems with their eFax accounts.
        - Collect meaningful data regarding customer portal use using WF Analytics.
        - Begin helping internal CCSI teams understand how we can use WF to meet their messaging and customer communication needs based on rate plans.

        <br/>

        Brian continues to be a truly valuable asset to my team, to Product, and to CCSI overall. He is a self- starter, who pushes the Whatfix agenda diligently and with the needed insight to make it productive for all of the products that have integrated WF into their UI/UX.

        <br/>
        
        Brian maintains an even level of professionalism with whomever he deals with, whether that be CCSI personnel, WF employees, or our CCSI customers. He is open, direct, and comfortable with sudden change (a CCSI fact of life). He thrives in our small team environment, but is not afraid to reach out to CCSI resources he is not familiar with in order to get work done (and to customers as well, when and if needed).

        <br/>

        Brian is very results oriented, and is very transparent about any perceived difficulties that may be encountered in a particular project. He is also very astute about best practices and implementing procedures. I like working with Brian; he is easy going and easy to get along with.

        <br/>

        (This final comment is for HR, [redacted], [redacted], and anyone else "calibrating" my comments regarding Brian. Honestly, he deserves the highest rating and a serious raise. It is difficult for me to give him the Sometimes Meets Expectations rating. I know these reviews need to be conducted in a certain way, but come on. Brian is a valuable asset. It is time CCSI recognized that openly and honestly with regards to Brian's compensation package. Just my two cents as his manager.)

        'Exceeding Expectations'

        Before Brian joined CCSI, we were not a team that had much use for
        user data, and in fact had no good way of obtaining it to even analyze. Brian has shown us the inner workings and benefits of using a tool like Whatfix, and has made our approach to providing jSign help truly data driven. We now know how our jSign customers are interacting with the app, and with the help, and we can target specific assistance to specific pain points, resulting in a better user experience. This is all very exciting and new for us. Brian has opened a whole new world for the team and we are finding new ways to contribute to the overall success of jSign, product, and CCSI. 

        <br/>

        It has only been six months, and his project queue has not been exceptionally varied in terms of the types of projects we given him, but Brian truly has exceeded our overall expectations in his primary work task, the integration of Whatfix into the jSign documentation workflow. He is a valuable addition to our team.
